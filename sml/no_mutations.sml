   Benefits of No Mutation

   - A major aspect and contribution of functional programming: Not being able to assign to (a.k.a. mutate) variables or parts of tuples and lists


   ML vs. Imperative languages

   - In ML, we create alliases all the time without thinking about it because it is impossible to tell where there is aliasing 

   - In languages with mutable data (e.g. Java), programmers are obsessed with aliasing and object identity
