# [Programming Languages](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang "Link to course in Coursera.org")
### by Dan Grossman 

Investigate the basic concepts behind programming languages, with a strong emphasis on the techniques and benefits of functional programming. 
Use the programming languages ML, Racket, and Ruby in ways that will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts. 
Gain new software skills and the concepts needed to learn new languages on your own.

## About the Course
Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. 
Develop a programming style known as functional programming and contrast it with object-oriented programming. 
Through experience writing programs and studying three different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using programming languages, 
such as modularity and the complementary benefits of static and dynamic typing. 
This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics – it will give you a framework for understanding 
how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, 
you learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. 
The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, 
and elegant programs – in any language.
